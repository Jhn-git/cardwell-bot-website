        <p class="mb-6">Welcome to Dr. Cardwell! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Dr. Cardwell Discord bot and any related services (collectively, the "Service"), provided by Jhn ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
        <p class="mb-6">By adding or using the Dr. Cardwell bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-emerald-300">1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Dr. Cardwell is a sophisticated Discord bot designed to assist with MCAT preparation. The Service provides users with pre-made flashcard decks, AI-powered generation of custom flashcards, semantic search capabilities, and other study tools. The Service operates on a "freemium" model, with basic features available for free and advanced features available through paid subscriptions.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-emerald-300">2. User Accounts and Conduct</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your Discord account in relation to our Service.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to engage in any conduct that is abusive, harassing, or disruptive.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 ml-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Exploiting bugs or glitches to gain an unfair advantage (e.g., generating free credits).</li>
            <li>Spamming commands or otherwise creating an unreasonable load on our servers.</li>
            <li>Attempting to reverse-engineer, decompile, or access the source code of the Service.</li>
            <li>Reselling or sub-licensing access to the Service or its premium features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-emerald-300">3. Subscriptions, Credits, and Payments</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 ml-4 space-y-2">
             <!-- SUGGESTION: Added color and consistent styling to bold tags -->
            <li><b class="font-semibold text-emerald-300">Subscriptions:</b> We offer several subscription tiers ("Pro User," "MCAT Guru") that provide access to premium features. These are recurring monthly subscriptions.</li>
            <li><b class="font-semibold text-emerald-300">Payments:</b> All payments for subscriptions are processed securely through Discord's native App Subscription system. We do not handle or store your credit card information.</li>
            <li><b class="font-semibold text-emerald-300">Credit System:</b> Premium features may consume "credits." Credits are granted based on your subscription tier. Credits have no real-world monetary value, cannot be redeemed for cash, and are used solely to measure usage of the Service. Unused credits do not roll over from month to month unless otherwise specified.</li>
            <li><b class="font-semibold text-emerald-300">Refunds:</b> All transactions are final. As payments are handled by Discord, you must adhere to Discord's refund policy. We generally do not offer refunds.</li>

However, by using the service, you grant us a license to use, store, and process that content as necessary to provide the Service to you.</li>

            <li><b class="font-semibold text-emerald-300">By Us:</b> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, without notice, for any conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful to the Service or other users.</li>
